# Azure Resource Manager In A Serverless World

So we have heard about using Infrastructure as Code to deploy our environments and resources, but how do we apply this in a world of Platform as a Service and Serverless? What tooling can we use, and how do we ensure our templates are created correctly?

In this session you will learn tips, best practices and techniques from real customers on using Azure Resource Manager templates to make your journey as smooth as possible. We will see how to get started on creating templates, how to easily move from portal to Infrastructure as Code, and what tools are available to help us with this. And we will dive even deeper, looking into deployment strategies, template testing and other scenarios.
